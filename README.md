# 🏃‍♂️ Exploratory Data Analysis on Athlete Performance Data
 
**Tools**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Jupyter

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing athlete race statistics — such as average speed, race times, and seasonal performance — to uncover trends and potential performance patterns.

The goal is to derive **insights from raw data** using **data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization techniques**. The project showcases my ability to work with real-world, imperfect data and communicate results visually.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Identify trends in athlete performance across race seasons.
- Visualize average speeds and outlier distributions.
- Apply grouping and aggregation to reveal summary statistics.
- Practice professional-grade EDA workflows in Jupyter.

## 🗃️ Dataset Source

This project uses data from **Kaggle: The Big Dataset of Ultra Marathon Running**.

- 📂 Dataset: [The Big Dataset of Ultra Marathon Running](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running)
- 📎 Author: [David E. Aiello](https://www.kaggle.com/aiaiaidavid)

> The dataset contains comprehensive information on ultra marathon athletes, races, distances, and average speeds. For more details, visit the original dataset page.


## 📊 Key Insights

- Race seasons show **clear variation in average speed**, which may reflect seasonal conditions or training cycles.
- **Outliers and skewness** are present and require attention before any modeling.
- Data required **column normalization** and renaming to support correct analysis.
